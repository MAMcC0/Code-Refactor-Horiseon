# Code-Refactor-Horiseon


## Description

  - The source code for Horiseon needed updates to its semantic elements both for 
    neatness and clarity. 
  - By adding more definite semantic elements instead of utlizing just divs the code 
    becomes more readable and future developers will be able to easily understand the
    function of all existing code.
